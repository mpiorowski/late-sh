# late-ssh Audio Context

## Metadata
- Domain: late.sh audio — Icecast house radio, global YouTube queue, browser/CLI source arbitration, synthetic browser-pair visualizer, now-playing poller, and future CLI voice-room audio decisions
- Primary audience: LLM agents working in `late-ssh/src/app/audio` and the touchpoints it owns in `late-cli` and `late-web/src/pages/connect`
- Last updated: 2026-06-02 (voice echo/stutter cleanup: CLI voice now uses LiveKit `PlatformAudio` for remote playout instead of a second CPAL output/FIFO, pair-WS keeps one `VoiceRuntimeState` across reconnects and sends periodic `voice_state`, and browser listen-only dedupes/detaches attached tracks. Prod LiveKit voice infra exists in `infra/livekit.tf`; `service-ssh` receives `LATE_VOICE_*`/`LATE_LIVEKIT_*` env vars from Terraform. Voice app/control code lives in `late-ssh/src/app/voice`, CLI media runtime lives in `late-cli/src/voice.rs`, and this file keeps only the audio-boundary and deployment context.)
- Previously: source arbitration simplified — no `ForceMute`; CLI gates Icecast on `set_playback_source`, and browsers only play web Icecast when no CLI is paired. Booth modal surfaces track durations: queue list has a right-aligned `m:ss` column between title and submitter, and the Now Playing row shows the same `m:ss` next to the title. Streams render `live`; unknown durations are blank. Both booth and staff `/audio` submit paths now validate through the YouTube Data API before insert, so queued rows carry server-side title/channel/`duration_ms`/`is_stream`. Browser/CLI player reports are diagnostics only; they never backfill duration or advance the shared queue.

## 1. Scope

Owned by this domain:
- Always-on Icecast house radio playback (the `<audio>` and CLI symphonia path).
- Global, DB-backed YouTube queue: submission, persistence, single-playing invariant, server-driven track switching (per-browser playback timeline), fallback debounce.
- The singleton "YouTube fallback" stream that plays when the queue is empty.
- Audio source arbitration between paired CLI and paired browser clients on the same SSH token (`set_playback_source` + browser Icecast gate).
- Synthetic browser-pair visualizer used for both Icecast and YouTube.
- Now-playing poller for the Icecast track title.
- The `/audio` and `/audio fallback` SSH chat commands (staff-only).

Out of scope here (lives elsewhere):
- Liquidsoap playlist/skip control — only called from `app/vote/svc.rs` (`liquidsoap.rs` is co-located here for historical reasons but is not used by `AudioService`).
- Icecast HTTP serving — external service, see root `CONTEXT.md` §2.7.
- CLI Icecast decode/output (`late-cli/src/audio/`) — owned by the CLI crate; this file only documents the WS/control wiring.
- The vote system that drives genre selection on Icecast.

---

## 3. Ownership Split

- `svc.rs` is the async boundary. It owns the DB, both broadcast channels, the queue state mutex, the playback timer (which also drives the periodic `LoadVideo` heartbeat for the current item), the fallback debounce timer, and all transitions. **Nothing else in the codebase mutates `media_queue_items.status` or `media_sources`.**
- `state.rs` is the per-session UI shim (62 lines). It clones the service, holds a per-user `AudioEvent` receiver, exposes `submit_trusted` / `set_youtube_fallback` for chat dispatch, and turns user-scoped events into banners during `tick()`.
- `client_state.rs` is type-only: the JSON shape clients send over `client_state` WS messages. No behavior.
- `youtube.rs` is pure URL/HTTP — no DB, no channels, no service state.
- `viz.rs` is pure render + signal smoothing. Lives in this domain because the data source (Icecast) is audio.
- `now_playing/svc.rs` is independent of `AudioService` — separate channel, separate task, only shares a directory.
- `liquidsoap.rs` is dead weight from this domain's perspective; kept here because the file got moved from `app/vote/` during consolidation and only `vote` re-imports it.

Keep `mod.rs` declaration-only — no `pub use` re-exports.

## 4. AudioService (`svc.rs`)

### Channels and state
- `ws_tx: broadcast::Sender<AudioWsMessage>` (cap 512) — server-authoritative pair-WS events, fanned out to every paired client.
- `event_tx: broadcast::Sender<AudioEvent>` (cap 256) — per-user banners (success/failure on submit, fallback set). Consumed only by `AudioState`.
- `state: Arc<Mutex<QueueState>>` — `{ mode: AudioMode, current_item_id, sequence, playback_cancel: Option<oneshot>, fallback_cancel: Option<oneshot> }`.

### Constants (`svc.rs:15-21`)
- `QUEUE_SNAPSHOT_LIMIT = 50`
- `MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_WINDOW = 10` over `SUBMISSION_WINDOW = 5 minutes` — applies to un-trusted `submit_url`, which is the path reached by the Music Booth submit modal (`booth_submit_public_task`). Trusted/admin paths (`submit_trusted_url`) bypass.
- `FALLBACK_DEBOUNCE = 10s`
- `PLAYBACK_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 10s` — periodic `LoadVideo` re-broadcast for the current item. Safety net: browsers already showing the right item no-op; stuck/disconnected/wrong-item browsers force-swap. Replaces the old `Seek`-based sync.
- `RECONCILE_INTERVAL = 60s` — background DB reconcile safety net. If memory drifts from the singleton `playing` row (e.g. rollout overlap), the service adopts the DB current, cancels/re-arms timers, and republishes state.
- `STREAM_CAP = 1h` — hard cap on any single playing row's wall-clock lifetime.
- `SKIP_VOTE_FRACTION = 0.3` + `SKIP_VOTE_MIN = 2` — `skip_threshold(youtube_total) = max(ceil(0.3 * youtube_total), 2)`. **Denominator is active users whose persisted `users.settings.audio_source` is `youtube`**, not paired-client/browser presence. Floor of 2 means a lone active YouTube-pref user can't solo-skip; the 30% ceil kicks in above 6 active YouTube-pref users.

### Public API
- `new(db, youtube_api_key)` — `main.rs:123`.
- `start_background_task(shutdown)` — sweeps orphan `playing` rows, then resumes from DB, then idles. `main.rs:360`.
- `subscribe_ws()` — `api.rs:237` (pair WS upgrade).
- `subscribe_events()` — `app/audio/state.rs`.
- `initial_ws_messages()` (`svc.rs:393-423`) — catch-up burst sent on every new pair-WS connect: `source_changed`, `queue_update`, and `load_video` for the current playing item or for the configured fallback.
- `snapshot()` — returns `QueueSnapshot { mode, current, queue }`. Type exists but no HTTP route exposes it (see §14).
- `submit_url` / `submit_url_task` — un-trusted, rate-limited, validates via YouTube Data API. **Called by `booth_submit_public_task`** (the in-TUI booth modal submit). Requires `LATE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY`; when unset, `booth_submit_enabled()` returns false and the modal disables the submit row. Inserted rows carry `title`, `channel`, `duration_ms`, and `is_stream` from the Data API — so booth-queued items render their `m:ss` duration in the queue list immediately.
- `booth_submit_public_task` — wraps `submit_url` for the booth modal: emits `AudioEvent::BoothSubmit{Queued,Failed}` (user-scoped banners) and shows "Disabled" if the API key is missing. **This is the user-facing submit path.**
- `submit_trusted_url` / `submit_trusted_url_task` — used by `/audio` (staff). Bypasses rate limit but still validates via YouTube Data API. Normal videos require a server-side duration; live streams set `is_stream=true` and use the 1h cap.
- `set_trusted_youtube_fallback` / `set_trusted_youtube_fallback_task` — used by `/audio fallback`. Also validates via YouTube Data API before upserting the singleton `media_sources` row.
- `report_player_state` / `report_player_state_task` — `api.rs:329`, ingress for browser `player_state` reports.

### Startup lifecycle
1. `sweep_orphan_playing` (`svc.rs:425-438`) marks any `status='playing'` row older than `now - 1h` as `failed` with `error = "orphan playing row swept at startup"`.
2. `resume_from_db` (`svc.rs:440-460`) reads the lone `playing` row (if any). If `started_at + duration` still in the future, broadcasts a fresh `LoadVideo` with the correct `offset_ms` and re-arms the playback timer. Otherwise marks it `played` and advances.
3. Service is then driven purely by inbound chat submissions, browser player_state reports, and timer fires.

### State machine
DB statuses: `queued → playing → {played | skipped | failed}`.

All transitions go through `svc.rs`:
- `queued → playing`: `mark_playing` conditional `UPDATE … WHERE id=$1 AND status='queued'`. Before promoting, `advance_to_next_with_guard` first checks for an existing DB `playing` row and adopts it. If `mark_playing` races the singleton index (`idx_media_queue_single_playing`), the service treats that as a reconcile signal instead of surfacing a submit failure.
- `playing → played`: `finish_item_due_to_timer` via `mark_played` (`WHERE status='playing'`). Client `ended` reports no longer call this path. If zero rows changed, memory was stale; reconcile from DB instead of returning with the old `current_item_id`.
- `playing → failed`: reserved for server-side cleanup/sweeps. Client `player_state: error` reports are informational and do **not** fail or advance the shared queue.
- `playing → skipped`: staff `/audio skip` and threshold skip use `mark_skipped` (`WHERE status='playing'`). A stale pod cannot mutate an already-played row to `skipped`; zero-row updates reconcile and ask the caller to retry.

`advance_to_next_with_guard` is the *only* advancer. It adopts a DB current first, otherwise picks `MediaQueueItem::first_queued()`, tries to flip it, on success broadcasts `SourceChanged: youtube` + `LoadVideo` + `QueueUpdate`. If the queue is empty it tries `publish_youtube_fallback_with_guard`; if no fallback row exists, `schedule_fallback` arms the 10s debounce, after which `finish_fallback_debounce` flips `mode = Icecast` (and re-checks `current_item_id.is_none()` to avoid races).

### Timers
- **Playback timer** (`schedule_playback_timer`): one `tokio::select!` task per playing item. Sleeps `duration - elapsed` then calls `finish_item_due_to_timer`. Also re-broadcasts `LoadVideo` for the current item every `PLAYBACK_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 10s` from inside the same task — the safety-net heartbeat. Browsers ignore the heartbeat when they're already showing the right item; otherwise they force-swap.
- **Fallback debounce**: one task armed when the queue drains. Cancelled by any new submission via `cancel_fallback`.
- **Periodic reconcile**: every 60s the service compares memory to the DB singleton `playing` row. Reconcile is a full transition: cancel stale timers, clear skip-votes if the current changed, schedule the DB current's timer, and republish queue/load events. If memory says current but DB has none, it clears stale state and advances/fallbacks.
- Timers are owned via `oneshot` cancel handles on `QueueState`; dropping the sender cancels the task.

### `playback_duration` rules (`svc.rs:1197-1205`)
- `is_stream = true` → always `STREAM_CAP` (1h).
- Non-stream with known `duration_ms >= 30s` → `min(duration_ms, STREAM_CAP)` — **1h is a hard cap on every item, not a fallback.** A 2h video plays its first hour, server timer fires, queue advances.
- Non-stream with missing or implausibly short duration is rejected at submit time. Legacy rows in that shape are marked `failed` before promotion/adoption, so old client-backfilled bad durations cannot shorten the timer.
- Client `ended`, `error`, and `duration_ms` reports are not used for advancement or timer scheduling. The server timer advances at `playback_duration`, so a 2h video is capped at 1h and a known 3min video advances at its server-validated duration even if the embedded player reports noisy startup/teardown states.

### `player_state` ingress
Routed by report `state` field:
- `ended` → report-only. It does **not** advance the queue and does not backfill duration. Queue advancement is owned by the server playback timer.
- `error` → warn-only. Client/player errors are not trusted as global queue truth because one surface can fail while another surface plays the item correctly.
- `playing` / `paused` / `buffering` → logged only. `autoplay_blocked = true` logs at `warn!`.
- `unstarted` / `cued` → accepted but report-only. The YouTube IFrame emits them around `loadVideoById`; they must never fail, advance, or backfill duration.
- Unknown future player states parse as `Unknown` and are ignored.

### Invariants
1. **Singleton playing row.** Enforced both by the partial unique index `idx_media_queue_single_playing` and by conditional `mark_playing` updates. Two racing advancers cannot both succeed; losers reconcile to the DB current.
2. **Server owns track *changes*, not playback positions.** Server picks which item is `playing` and broadcasts `LoadVideo` on changes + every 10s as a heartbeat. Each browser plays its own timeline from wherever YT happens to start. No more wall-clock-offset sync — slow networks no longer audibly skip mid-track.
3. **Force-switch on heartbeat.** A browser receiving `LoadVideo` for a different `item_id` than what it's currently playing MUST swap, regardless of pause/buffer/error state. Same-`item_id` heartbeat with the right `video_id` loaded → no-op (respect a manual pause).
4. **`ended` is not trusted for queue advancement.** Browsers and the CLI webview can report `ended`, but the server treats it as diagnostics only. The playback timer is the only normal `playing → played` path, which keeps embedded-webview startup/teardown state churn from skipping tracks.
5. **Mode is server-managed.** Browser/CLI never write `mode`; they only receive `SourceChanged`.
6. **Sequence monotonicity.** `state.sequence` is bumped before every `QueueUpdate` so clients can drop stale ones.
7. **Banners are user-scoped.** `AudioEvent` carries `user_id` and `AudioState::tick` filters on it; one user's submission failure does not leak to others.
8. **DB beats memory on drift.** Any zero-row terminal transition (`mark_played` / `mark_skipped`) or singleton conflict routes through reconcile. Reconcile never blindly clears `current_item_id` while DB still has a `playing` row.

---

## 5. WebSocket Protocol (multiplexed on `/api/ws/pair`)

`api.rs` `handle_socket` (`api.rs:231-382`) drives three sources per connection with `tokio::select!`:
- inbound `socket.recv()` — client → server
- `control_rx` — `PairControlMessage` from `PairedClientRegistry` (mute/volume/source/clipboard)
- `audio_rx` — `AudioWsMessage` from `AudioService::subscribe_ws()`

On connect, `api.rs` sends the user's persisted `set_playback_source` first, then
`audio_service.initial_ws_messages()` emits the catch-up burst. This ordering keeps
the browser from briefly assuming the default Icecast preference and staging a
YouTube item without entering the switching/playback path.

### Server → client `AudioWsMessage` (tagged enum, snake_case)
- `load_video { item_id, video_id, is_stream }` — sent on track changes AND every 10s as a heartbeat. Browsers swap when `item_id` differs from what they're playing; same-item heartbeat is a no-op.
- `source_changed { audio_mode: "icecast" | "youtube" }`
- `queue_update { current, queue, sequence }`

### Server → client `PairControlMessage` (`paired_clients.rs:22-30`)
- `toggle_mute`, `volume_up`, `volume_down`, `request_clipboard_image`.
- `set_playback_source { source: "icecast" | "youtube", web_icecast_enabled: bool, embedded_webview_enabled: bool }` — sent immediately on pair-WS connect, after persisted `v+x` source changes, and when CLI/browser presence changes. CLI ignores `web_icecast_enabled`; browsers use it to avoid double Icecast when a CLI is paired. Native CLI uses `embedded_webview_enabled` to start the webview helper only when no real browser connect page is paired.

### Client → server `WsPayload` (`api.rs:39-68`)
- `heartbeat`
- `viz { position_ms, bands[8], rms }` — legacy/compat payload; the current web page does not send it
- `client_state { client_kind, ssh_mode, platform, capabilities, muted, volume_percent }`
- `clipboard_image { … }`, `clipboard_image_failed { … }`
- `player_state(PlayerStateReport)` — `{ item_id, state, offset_ms?, duration_ms?, autoplay_blocked, error? }` (`svc.rs:126-138`)

There is **one global broadcast**, no room scoping. Every paired browser on every token receives the same `load_video` / `source_changed` / `queue_update`.

---

## 6. Source Arbitration (single audible surface)

Policy lives in `late-ssh/src/paired_clients.rs` plus the browser/CLI followers. There is no `ForceMute` control message anymore; the server broadcasts `set_playback_source { source, web_icecast_enabled, embedded_webview_enabled }` and clients gate themselves.

Rule: **Icecast belongs to the CLI when a CLI is paired; YouTube belongs to a real browser when one is paired, otherwise to the CLI webview helper.** When a CLI and browser are both paired and the user flips from YouTube back to Icecast, the browser pauses/silences YouTube and does **not** start its own Icecast `<audio>` element, preventing doubled radio streams. When a real browser pairs while the CLI helper is active, the server replays `set_playback_source` with `embedded_webview_enabled=false` so the native CLI closes the helper; when that browser disconnects, the replay flips it back to `true`.

| CLI paired | Real browser paired | Source  | Audible surface                                      |
|------------|---------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| yes        | no                  | Icecast | CLI                                                  |
| yes        | no                  | YouTube | CLI embedded webview helper                          |
| yes        | yes                 | Icecast | CLI; browser web-Icecast disabled                    |
| yes        | yes                 | YouTube | browser iframe; CLI webview helper disabled          |
| no         | yes                 | Icecast | browser `<audio>` (`web_icecast_enabled = true`)     |
| no         | yes                 | YouTube | browser iframe                                       |

Mechanics:
- `PairControlMessage::SetPlaybackSource { source, web_icecast_enabled, embedded_webview_enabled }` is sent on pair-WS connect, on persisted `v+x` source changes, and when CLI or real-browser presence changes for a token.
- CLI stores `source_is_icecast`; output emits silence when `source != Icecast` without touching the user `muted` flag.
- Native CLI spawns the embedded webview only for `source=Youtube && embedded_webview_enabled=true`; `false` kills the helper while leaving YouTube selected so the real browser can play.
- Browser stores `webIcecastEnabled`; `source=Icecast && webIcecastEnabled=false` pauses YouTube and stops the web Icecast element. If the CLI disconnects, the server replays the same source with `web_icecast_enabled=true` so a browser-only token can resume web Icecast.

### Skip-vote eligibility — YouTube source preference

Skip-vote uses the persisted preference cached on active users. If an active user's `users.settings.audio_source = "youtube"`, they can cast a skip vote and count toward the threshold. Pairing shape is intentionally ignored: CLI-only, embedded-webview, and real-browser users with the same saved preference all count the same. Offline users do not count.

Helpers used by the skip-vote path:
- `User::audio_source(user_id)` — gates the caller: only users whose saved preference is `Youtube` can vote.
- `ActiveUsers[*].audio_source` — cached from the user's settings on login and updated after `v+x`; feeds both the sidebar tags and skip threshold.
- `PairedClientRegistry::set_audio_source(user_id, source)` — only mirrors the new preference to connected clients via `SetPlaybackSource`; it no longer defines listener counts.

Vote-strip on flip-away: when the DB value transitions from `Youtube` to `Icecast`, `AudioService::persist_audio_source` removes the user from `state.skip_votes` and runs `reevaluate_skip_threshold` (which may fire a skip if the threshold dropped to meet remaining votes).

Eligibility table:

| Saved `audio_source` | Can skip-vote? | Counts toward threshold? |
|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Icecast/default      | no             | no                       |
| Youtube              | yes            | yes                      |

A user always contributes at most one vote (`HashSet<Uuid>` on `user_id`) and counts once in the denominator while active. Staff `/audio skip` (`force_skip`) bypasses the threshold entirely.

## 7. Chat Commands (`/audio`, `/audio fallback`, `/audio skip`)

Parsing: `late-ssh/src/app/chat/state.rs` around the `/audio` block.
- Exact match `/audio skip` is checked first (otherwise `strip_prefix("/audio ")` would treat `skip` as a URL).
- Longer prefix `/audio fallback ` is matched next.
- Staff gate: `is_admin || is_moderator`. Non-staff get banner `"/audio is staff-only"`.
- Empty arg → `"Usage: /audio <youtube-url>"` or `"Usage: /audio fallback <youtube-url>"`.
- Valid requests stash into `requested_audio_url` / `requested_audio_fallback_url` / `requested_audio_skip`.

Dispatch: `late-ssh/src/app/chat/input.rs` `handle_post_submit_requests` calls `app.audio.submit_trusted(url)`, `app.audio.set_youtube_fallback(url)`, or `app.audio.skip_trusted()`, which proxy through `AudioState` to `AudioService::{submit_trusted_url_task, set_trusted_youtube_fallback_task, force_skip_task}`.

The unrelated bare `/music` command (`state.rs:1325`) opens a help topic, not a submission. Don't confuse the two — `/music` ≠ submit.

`/audio` flow:
1. `YoutubeClient::validate_url(url)` extracts the ID and calls YouTube Data API. Accepted forms: `youtube.com/watch?v=…`, `youtu.be/…`, `youtube.com/embed/…`, `youtube.com/shorts/…`, `youtube.com/live/…`, subdomains via `host.ends_with(".youtube.com")`. Anything else returns an `anyhow` error (lowercase, per repo style).
2. Validation rejects missing API key, not-found/non-public/non-embeddable videos, upcoming streams, normal videos without duration, and normal videos shorter than 30s. Live streams are accepted with `is_stream=true`.
3. `MediaQueueItem::insert_youtube` writes the row with `status='queued'`, `media_kind='youtube'`, title/channel/duration/is_stream from the server-side metadata.
4. If nothing is currently playing, `advance_to_next_with_guard` immediately flips it to `playing` and broadcasts.
5. On success, banner via `AudioEvent::TrustedSubmitQueued` — "Queued audio — up next" or "Queued audio — #N in line" depending on position. On failure (URL parse, API key/validation, DB), banner via `AudioEvent::TrustedSubmitFailed` carrying a classified message from `trusted_submit_error_message`.

`/audio fallback` flow:
1. `YoutubeClient::validate_url(url)` (same server-side validation as `/audio`).
2. `MediaSource::upsert_youtube_fallback` — `ON CONFLICT (source_kind) DO UPDATE`, always sets `is_stream=true` because fallback playback is not a queue item with a completion timer.
3. If the queue is empty *and* no item is playing, immediately broadcasts `SourceChanged: youtube` + `LoadVideo` for the fallback so paired browsers start it without waiting.
4. On success, banner via `AudioEvent::YoutubeFallbackSet` — "Set YouTube fallback". On failure, banner via `AudioEvent::YoutubeFallbackFailed` carrying the classified message from `trusted_submit_error_message`.

`/audio skip` flow:
1. Routes through `AudioService::force_skip` — unconditional, bypasses the vote threshold; staff can skip directly.
2. Marks the current playing row `skipped` via `MediaQueueItem::mark_skipped` (`WHERE status='playing'`), clears `current_item_id` and any pending `skip_votes`, cancels the playback timer, and runs `advance_to_next_with_guard` to bring up the next queued item (or arm the fallback debounce).
3. If the row was already no longer `playing`, the service reconciles from DB instead of mutating the stale row and asks the caller to retry. On success, banner via `AudioEvent::TrustedSkipFired` — "Skipped audio". On failure (nothing playing, state changed, DB error), banner via `AudioEvent::TrustedSkipFailed` — "Nothing is playing" or "Failed to skip audio".

---

## 8. CLI Integration

Goal: the CLI tolerates everything new the audio domain added, plays Icecast when selected, and stays silent when the user selects YouTube.

- **Unknown audio events ignored** (`late-cli/src/ws.rs`). Inbound text is parsed only as `PairControlMessage`. `load_video`, `source_changed`, `queue_update` fail to deserialize, the CLI logs `warn!("ignoring unsupported pair websocket event")`, and the select loop continues. **The CLI does not disconnect on audio events.** Note: each playing track now also produces a 10s `load_video` heartbeat — the CLI log noise budget should account for that.
- **Source gate, not forced mute.** `set_playback_source` updates `source_is_icecast`; `late-cli/src/audio/output.rs` emits silence when it is false. The user-controlled `muted` atomic remains only the local mute keybind / paired mute control.
- **Embedded YouTube webview lifecycle.** The same `set_playback_source` message drives `late-cli/src/ws.rs::WebviewPlaybackController`: `youtube` spawns one `late webview-pair` child only when `embedded_webview_enabled=true` and writes the session token over the child's stdin pipe; `icecast` or `embedded_webview_enabled=false` kills the helper. Do **not** spawn the helper from global `source_changed`.
- **AT-SPI bridge isolation.** The parent CLI spawns the helper with `NO_AT_BRIDGE=1`. This scopes the workaround to the helper process and avoids `libatk-bridge-2.0.so` SIGSEGV crashes caused by stale `at-spi-bus-launcher`/dbus state on some Linux desktops.
- **Embedded webview initial seek only.** On helper open, `late-cli/src/webview/pair.rs` uses the first `queue_update.current.started_at_ms` snapshot to apply a one-shot `startSeconds` to the first matching `load_video`. If a `load_video` arrives before the initial snapshot, the relay buffers it and flushes it when the snapshot decision is known. Once that first load is dispatched, server heartbeats and later queue track switches keep the normal no-offset behavior.
- **YouTube capability.** Native CLI `client_state.capabilities` includes `"youtube"` on desktop platforms. The server still sends `set_playback_source` to every paired entry; older/plain CLIs simply gate Icecast, while YouTube-capable CLIs also launch the helper.
- **CLI identifies itself.** First native `client_state` emitted by `late-cli/src/ws.rs` carries `"client_kind": "cli"`. The helper sends `"client_kind": "browser"` plus `"ssh_mode": "webview"` so existing browser paths still work, while the server can distinguish it from a real browser connect page.

## 9. Web Connect Page Integration

File: `late-web/src/pages/connect/page.html`. The audio source is decided in the browser; the YouTube API/player is lazy-loaded only when the browser actually enters YouTube mode.

- **Per-user audio source (server-authoritative).** The choice is persisted in `users.settings.audio_source` (`icecast` | `youtube`, default `icecast`). TUI `v+x` flips the value via `App::toggle_paired_playback_source`: writes to DB through `AudioService::persist_audio_source`, updates the local mirror `App.paired_browser_source`, and broadcasts `PairControlMessage::SetPlaybackSource { source, web_icecast_enabled, embedded_webview_enabled }` to paired clients. On pair-WS connect, `api.rs` sends the persisted source before the audio catch-up burst. On browser pair-up and disconnect the SSH session replays the value; on CLI presence changes `api.rs` also replays it for the token so browsers know whether web Icecast is allowed and CLIs know whether the embedded webview fallback is allowed. The browser is a follower: `applyUserPlaybackSource(source, web_icecast_enabled)` stores `userOverrideMode` and applies. While the user is pinned to icecast, `loadYoutubeVideo` early-returns so server queue events do not flip the iframe back on (the current item is still stashed as `pendingYoutubeItem` so a toggle to youtube starts playing immediately). The native CLI follows the same source message: it gates Icecast locally and only spawns the embedded webview helper for `youtube` when no real browser is paired.
- **IFrame API load.** The page does not include the YouTube iframe API up front. `ensureYoutubePlayer()` calls `loadYoutubeApi()` on demand, which appends `https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api`; `window.lateYoutubeApiReady` / `onYouTubeIframeAPIReady` then create the player only if `audioMode === "youtube"`.
- **`source_changed` / `set_playback_source` swap** (`applySourceMode`). Into `youtube`: stop `<audio>`, ensure player exists, kick playback of pending item. Into `icecast`: `ytPlayer.pauseVideo()`; restart the web `<audio>` only when `webIcecastEnabled` is true. With a CLI paired, `webIcecastEnabled=false`, so the browser goes quiet and the CLI is the only Icecast surface. The `modeChanged` guard prevents repeated `source_changed: youtube` broadcasts during queue transitions from resetting the iframe.
- **Icecast-pinned resource behavior.** While pinned to Icecast, `load_video` only stashes `pendingYoutubeItem`; it does not create the YouTube iframe or pre-cue the video. A later source flip to YouTube starts from the pending item, and the server's 10s `load_video` heartbeat remains the safety net.
- **`load_video` → force-switch or no-op** (`loadYoutubeVideo`). New shape: payload is `{ item_id, video_id, is_stream }` — no offset, no started_at. Same `item_id` AND iframe is already showing the right `video_id` → no-op (this is the safety-net heartbeat path; a manual pause stays paused). Otherwise → `loadVideoById({ videoId })` from 0, swap `currentYoutubeItem`. `verifyYoutubeLoad` re-checks after 1s and reloads if the video id still mismatches.
- **No drift correction.** Each browser plays its own timeline. Slow networks just lag behind — no `seekTo` jumps. The "everyone hears the same offset" invariant is dropped on purpose.
- **`player_state` reports** (`sendYoutubeState`). Emits `{ event: 'player_state', item_id, state, offset_ms, duration_ms, autoplay_blocked, error }` on YT state transitions (PLAYING/PAUSED/BUFFERING/ENDED). No periodic loop. Server logs these for diagnostics only; player reports never backfill duration, reschedule timers, or advance the queue.
- **Autoplay-blocked**. 1.5s after `loadVideoById`, if the YT state is still `CUED`/`UNSTARTED`, sets `autoplayBlocked = true`, emits `player_state: buffering` with the flag, and the UI swaps to `[ tap to play ]`. Tap routes through `startPlayback` → `ytPlayer.playVideo()`.
- **`queue_update` is currently a no-op** in the browser (no UI to show it). The event ships so a future surface can use it.

---

## 10. Visualizer (`viz.rs`)

- Browser-paired audio is synthetic-only for both Icecast and YouTube. The web
  page does not create a Web Audio `AudioContext`, does not run an analyzer, and
  does not send `viz` frames.
- `app/tick.rs` turns `Visualizer::procedural_active` on only when the browser
  is the audible surface: YouTube mode, or browser-only Icecast
  (`web_icecast_enabled = true`). If a CLI is paired and the user is in
  Icecast mode, the CLI owns Icecast and real CLI `VizFrame`s remain visible.
- `render_inline(frame, area)` is the borderless sidebar render. Idle shows `"no audio paired"` / `"/music in chat"` / `"? guide pair"` (last only when height ≥ 5). Real CLI frames use attack/release smoothing, idle band decay, and the same **sub-cell vertical resolution** (`▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█`, 9-step) as the procedural path; real bars use dim/normal/glow amber by intensity. Procedural live draws dim amber 1-cell-wide bars with 1-cell gaps. Bar heights come from layered sines — a primary traveling wave, a faster per-band shimmer, and a slow global breath term (incommensurate frequencies so the pattern doesn't visibly repeat in a few seconds). No spectrum-style tilt is applied on the procedural path; the wave shape is decorative, not a frequency analog.
- The `VizFrame`/`Visualizer::update` path still drives CLI Icecast
  visualization. Browser web playback no longer sends those frames, and
  procedural rendering takes priority only while the browser is the audible
  surface.

**Future unlock: OS audio loopback.** Once the CLI hosts its own playback (embedded webview track), the cross-origin constraint disappears entirely — we capture local audio output at the OS layer (PipeWire / WASAPI / ScreenCaptureKit) and feed real `VizFrame`s through the existing pipeline for every source, including YouTube. See §18 for the parked plan. Until that lands, procedural bars are the only honest YouTube-mode indicator.

---

## 11. Now-Playing (`now_playing/svc.rs`)

- Shared `watch::Sender<Option<NowPlaying>>` reflects the current Icecast track title.
- `start_poll_task` spawns a blocking thread that calls `late_core::icecast::fetch_track` every 10s (split into 1s sleeps to shut down quickly). Only emits when the title string changes.
- Independent of `AudioService` — does not subscribe to its channels.
- Consumers: `GET /api/now-playing` (`api.rs:131`), and the sidebar music-stage widget (`app/common/sidebar.rs::draw_icecast_block`) which renders `Artist - Title` plus a progress/elapsed line under the icecast title. When the watch hasn't ticked yet, the block shows `no signal` and the progress row stays blank.

---

## 12. Sidebar music-stage widget (`common/sidebar.rs`)

Renders the audio domain into the right rail. Both surfaces (YouTube + Icecast) are always visible; the active source the user is hearing gets bold amber chrome, the other gets dim italic. Entry point: `app/common/sidebar.rs:draw_music_stage`, allocated `MUSIC_STAGE_HEIGHT = 17` rows. Both blocks share the same row shape — title, track (combined on one line), progress, then surface-specific tail — so the active/inactive comparison reads naturally.

### Layout

| Row(s) | Content |
|--------|---------|
| 0      | Volume bar: `vol  ▰▰▰▰▰▱▱▱▱▱  60%`. Renders `muted` (italic faint) when muted, `—` when no client is paired. |
| 1      | Volume keybind hints: `m mute  -= vol`. |
| 2-7    | YouTube block: title bar, track (`Channel - Title` combined on one row; falls back to `by <submitter> - Title` when channel is unknown, then to bare title), progress, skip meter (with trailing `v+s` hint when active), `next ⌄` header, queue items (`Min(2)`, absorbs spare space). |
| 8      | Booth/swap keybind hints: `v+v queue  v+x swap`. |
| 9-13   | Icecast block: title bar, track (`Artist - Title` combined on one row), progress/elapsed line (uses `draw_progress_line` when `duration_seconds` is known, `draw_elapsed_line` otherwise), `vibe → next · ends` one-liner, then a 3-row vote area delegated to `app/vote/ui.rs::draw_vote_inline`. Track + progress fall back to `no signal` and a blank row when the `now_playing` watch hasn't emitted yet. |

### Active-source rule

```rust
yt_active = paired_browser_source == AudioSource::Youtube
```

Pure preference-based. Does **not** gate on `is_browser`. The saved preference (loaded from `users.settings.audio_source` via `extract_audio_source` during SSH bootstrap, `ssh.rs:883`, mirrored in `App.paired_browser_source`) is the source of truth from the first frame. Pairing-completion does not change the visual state — earlier versions waited for the browser to pair before honoring the pref, which read as a startup glitch (sidebar showed Icecast for ~1s then flipped). Don't add the `is_browser` guard back.

The volume row stays honest about pairing (`vol  —` when nothing paired), so users aren't misled about whether their preference is currently audible.

### Title-bar source tags

Both blocks always show the active users' saved source-preference count in the title-bar tag slot — `youtube  ────  5` / `icecast  ────  12`. Active vs inactive is communicated by color/weight (amber bold vs italic faint), not by case (label is always lowercase) and not by tag presence. The counts come from `ActiveUsers[*].audio_source` and ignore whether those users are currently paired/listening.

### Fallback-not-empty semantics

The widget treats "no submitted track" and "fallback playing" as the same state. When `queue.current.is_none()`:
- Title tag still shows the YouTube source count (no separate "loop"/"fallback" badge anymore — the body row carries that information).
- Body renders `fallback stream` / `YouTube · 24/7` plus a `queue with v+v` hint.
- When a track is playing but queue is otherwise empty, the trailing "next" row says `· fallback next`, not "queue ends".

No copy anywhere reads "queue empty". The user has pushed back on that wording multiple times; in their product framing the fallback is the steady state, not a placeholder. See `feedback_fallback_not_empty.md` in auto-memory.

### Data sources

- `queue_snapshot: &QueueSnapshot` — from `AudioState::queue_snapshot()` watch channel.
- `vote: VoteCardView<'_>` — from the genre vote state.
- `paired_client: Option<&ClientAudioState>` — for `volume_percent` and `muted` (vol row only).
- `paired_browser_source: AudioSource` — App's per-user mirror.
- `youtube_source_count: usize` / `icecast_source_count: usize` — counts from active users' cached `audio_source` via `AudioService::{youtube,icecast}_source_count()`. Pair/browser presence is ignored; offline users are excluded.
- `now_playing: Option<&NowPlaying>` — Icecast title + duration source, from `NowPlayingService` (§11). Drives the icecast track and progress rows.

### Internal helpers (all in `sidebar.rs`)

- `stage_title_line(area_w, label, tag, active)` — shared title-bar renderer. Label is always lowercase. Active → amber bold label + amber-dim tag; inactive → italic faint label + tag. No `▶ ` glyph prefix on the tag (color + position read as a state badge; the prefix was eating cells on narrow rails).
- `draw_volume_row` — the vol bar.
- `draw_keybind_row(frame, area, &[(key, label), ...])` — adaptive hint renderer; drops trailing groups when the rail is too narrow rather than mid-word truncating.
- `draw_youtube_block` / `draw_icecast_block` — fixed-size block renderers.
- `skip_meter_spans(progress)` — includes a trailing `v+s` keybind hint inline.
- `queue_next_line(idx, item, width)` — number flush at column 0 (no leading indent) to maximize title width.

### Cross-cuts

- Reuses `late-ssh/src/app/vote/ui.rs::draw_vote_inline` for the icecast vote rows. That helper uses `●`/`○` glyphs (matches the `seat_dot_spans` pattern), not block bars.
- v+x dispatch goes through `app/state.rs::toggle_paired_playback_source` → persists `paired_browser_source` via `AudioService::persist_audio_source`, which updates every paired registry entry for the user and broadcasts `PairControlMessage::SetPlaybackSource { source, web_icecast_enabled, embedded_webview_enabled }`. The preference is meaningful even with only a CLI paired: Icecast mode plays native CLI radio, while YouTube mode silences native Icecast and starts the embedded webview helper on capable CLI builds when no real browser is paired.

## 13. Data Model

### `media_queue_items` (migration `047`)
- `id` uuidv7, `created`/`updated` tz, `submitter_id → users ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- `media_kind` CHECK `IN ('youtube')`, `external_id` non-empty, `title`/`channel` nullable, `duration_ms ≥ 0` nullable, `is_stream BOOLEAN`.
- `status` CHECK `IN ('queued','playing','played','skipped','failed')`. `skipped` is reserved/unused.
- `started_at`, `ended_at`, `error` nullable.
- Indices: `(status, created)` for queue scans; `(submitter_id, created DESC)` for rate-limit / submitter views.
- **Singleton playing constraint:** `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_media_queue_single_playing ON media_queue_items ((true)) WHERE status = 'playing'`.

### `media_sources` (migration `048`)
- `id` uuidv7, timestamps, `source_kind` CHECK `IN ('youtube_fallback')`, `media_kind` CHECK `IN ('youtube')`.
- `external_id` non-empty, `title`, `channel`, `is_stream BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true`, `updated_by → users ON DELETE SET NULL`.
- Unique index on `source_kind` → singleton fallback row, upserted via `MediaSource::upsert_youtube_fallback`.

Model helpers (`late-core/src/models/media_queue_item.rs`, `media_source.rs`):
- `MediaQueueItem::{insert_youtube, find_by_id, list_snapshot, queued_before_count, recent_submission_count, first_queued, current_playing, mark_playing, mark_played, mark_failed, mark_skipped, sweep_orphan_playing}`. Status/kind constants: `STATUS_QUEUED`, `STATUS_PLAYING`, `STATUS_PLAYED`, `STATUS_SKIPPED`, `STATUS_FAILED`, `KIND_YOUTUBE`.
- `MediaSource::{youtube_fallback, upsert_youtube_fallback}`. Constants: `KIND_YOUTUBE_FALLBACK`, `MEDIA_KIND_YOUTUBE`.

## 14. Known Gaps and Things to Watch

- **`GET /api/queue` is intentionally not exposed.** `AudioService::snapshot()` and `QueueSnapshot` exist for in-process use only. The TUI booth modal reads the snapshot from `AudioState::queue_snapshot()` (a `watch::Receiver<QueueSnapshot>` populated by `publish_queue_update_with_guard`); browsers receive state via the `initial_ws_messages` catch-up burst and live `queue_update` events. An external route would only matter for non-paired observers, which we do not have today.
- **Booth modal renders from `watch::Receiver<QueueSnapshot>`.** `AudioService` keeps a `snapshot_tx` watch sender alongside the broadcast channels; every `publish_queue_update_with_guard` uses `send_replace` to store the latest snapshot even when zero receivers are alive (startup often publishes before any SSH booth exists), and `AudioState::queue_snapshot()` borrows the current value. Skip progress (`votes/threshold`) is folded into the snapshot before it ships.
- **`liquidsoap.rs` lives here but is only used by `app/vote/svc.rs`.** AudioService does *not* drive Liquidsoap. Treat `AudioMode::Icecast` as a hint to the browser/CLI, not a Liquidsoap state change.
- **`/music` ≠ `/audio`.** `/music` is a help-topic command. `/audio` (and `/audio fallback`) are the submit commands. Don't conflate.
- **No `GET /api/queue` HTTP route.** Submit and visibility for end users happen through the SSH booth modal (submit + queue list) and the staff `/audio` chat command. Non-paired observers have no way to see the queue today.
- **Multi-tab double audio** is unsolved. Two browser tabs on the same token both play. Deferred until UI work.
- **Region locks / embedding disabled** may still be partly regional. `/audio` and booth both use the YouTube Data API now, so public/non-embeddable/upcoming/duration failures are caught at submit time. A client may still report `error`, but the server treats that as diagnostics only.
- **`LATE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY` is optional at config load** (`config.rs:200`, `optional()`), but YouTube submissions and fallback updates require it at runtime. Without it, booth submit is disabled and staff `/audio` fails validation.
- **Queue state-drift / singleton-violation stuck state.** Took down prod once already (2026-05-19). The class of bug is non-atomic two-write transitions (DB row status + in-memory `state.current_item_id`); any divergence is unrecoverable without a pod restart. The reconciliation contract in §19 is the active fix — any new code that flips `media_queue_items.status` or mutates `current_item_id` must route through it.

---

## 15. Design boundaries (won.t build)

These are intentional non-goals. Reopen only if the constraint that put them here changes.

- **CLI YouTube decoding via shell-out to an external player (mpv/vlc/yt-dlp wrapper).** Won't ship. The user-side ToS exposure (yt-dlp strips ads/branding) and the config burden (most users don't have a player wired up) put this firmly out of scope. The legal path for CLI-side YouTube is an embedded webview hosting the official IFrame Player.
- **Server-side YouTube fetching.** Server routes `video_id` only; the iframe is the only thing that talks to googlevideo.com.
- **Recording / persistent archive of YouTube audio.** Blocked by YouTube ToS.
- **Ad stripping.** The iframe plays whatever YouTube serves.
- **Lyrics, album art, fancy metadata.** Title + channel is enough.
- **Custom genre control per submission.** Fallback uses the global vote winner like everywhere else.
- **Real Web Audio analysis of the YouTube iframe.** Not possible — cross-origin iframe, no audio hook in the IFrame Player API. Browser-paired audio therefore uses the same synthetic visualizer for both Icecast and YouTube (§10) until OS-loopback capture exists.

---

## 16. Deferred (open backlog)

Open work that's been deliberately punted past v1. Each line is a "we know it's missing, here's the next-time hook."

- **Public `POST /api/queue/submit` HTTP route.** Booth submit goes through the in-process service. Revive when there's a non-SSH submitter (web form, third-party). YouTube Data API validation path is already in code (un-trusted route in `AudioService::submit_url_task`).
- **`GET /api/queue` HTTP route.** Snapshot exists in-process (`QueueSnapshot`); no external consumer today. See §14 first bullet.
- **TUI sidebar widget on Home for queue visibility.** Booth modal is the only surface today.
- **Heartbeat cadence tuning.** 10s `LoadVideo` re-broadcast was carried over from the old `PLAYBACK_SYNC_INTERVAL`. Could be slower (30s) once we have confidence stuck browsers don't accumulate.
- **Multi-tab dedupe.** Two browser tabs on the same token both play. Needs a "primary tab" election or a single-tab-per-token enforcement.
- **Region-lock partial failure UX.** Data API validation catches public/embeddable metadata but not every playback-region failure. Client errors are warn-only today because one surface can fail while another succeeds.
- **Better admin feedback** when DB insert fails after local URL validation succeeds.
- **Browser-side voting UI.** Protocol already carries `vote_score` per item and `skip_progress` on the current item; no client renders them yet.
- **Weighted votes by role** (admin/mod ≠ user) — currently 1 user = 1 vote.
- **Vote history / reputation.**

---

## 17. CLI Embedded Webview for YouTube

**Status: v1 wired into the normal `late-cli` build.** Goal: legal YouTube playback inside the `late` CLI without shelling out to mpv/yt-dlp/etc. The CLI hosts the official YouTube IFrame Player inside an embedded system webview; the player fetches and decodes audio identically to today's connect page (§9). late.sh still ships only `video_id` over the pair WS.

### Process model

- Native `late` remains the always-on SSH/audio control process.
- Native `late` opens the normal pair WS as `client_kind = "cli"`.
- Native `late` advertises `capabilities: ["clipboard_image", "youtube"]` on desktop platforms.
- `set_playback_source: youtube` spawns a helper child (`late webview-pair`, token on stdin) only when `embedded_webview_enabled=true`.
- A real browser connect page paired on the same token sets `embedded_webview_enabled=false`, so browser YouTube is the escape hatch when the embedded webview stack fails on a user's machine.
- `set_playback_source: icecast` kills the helper and resumes native Icecast.
- The helper opens its own pair WS and reports `client_kind = "browser", ssh_mode = "webview"` so existing browser paths work while policy can distinguish it from a real browser tab.

This lazy lifecycle is intentional. A normal CLI run does not open a webview. A webview window exists only while the user's persisted playback source is YouTube and no real browser is paired, avoiding tiling-window-manager noise for Icecast users and keeping the manual browser fallback available.

### Source semantics

`set_playback_source` is the user's per-user preference and is the only signal that starts/stops the helper. `source_changed` is global queue/server mode and must not spawn the helper by itself. A user pinned to Icecast can still receive `source_changed: youtube` because the shared queue/fallback is globally active.

`embedded_webview_enabled` is surface policy, not a separate user preference. It is `false` whenever a real browser connect page is paired, and `true` again after that browser disconnects. The helper's own pair connection sends `ssh_mode = "webview"` and does not suppress itself.

### Webview backend

`late-cli` uses `wry` + `tao`:

- Linux: WebKitGTK 4.1 dev/runtime packages plus GStreamer playback plugins. On Arch/EndeavourOS, `gst-plugins-good` is required for `autoaudiosink`; without it WebKit logs `GStreamer element autoaudiosink not found` and the YouTube iframe can remain black/unstarted even though pair/load events succeeded. `gst-libav` is also recommended for codec coverage.
- macOS: WKWebView.
- Windows: WebView2.

The helper serves `late-cli/src/webview/page.html` from a loopback-only ephemeral HTTP listener and loads it as `http://localhost:<port>/` in the webview. Do not switch this back to `WebViewBuilder::with_html`: Wry's HTML string path gives the page a null origin, and YouTube can reject the iframe with player error 153. Do not expose the page URL as `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` either: a real incident with `r6L-GUOAhGo` showed YouTube IFrame error 150 / "Video unavailable / Watch on YouTube" from the CLI webview while the same controlled helper worked after changing the page URL to `localhost`. The server also sends `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, the page declares the same policy in a `<meta name="referrer">`, and the page passes `window.location.origin` into the IFrame Player `origin` parameter. The page posts `player_state` back through wry IPC, and Rust relays those events to `/api/ws/pair` while pushing `load_video` / `source_changed` into JS via `evaluate_script`. The helper suppresses transient `unstarted`/`cued` reports and ignores `ended` until the current item has first reached `playing`, because the IFrame can emit startup/teardown states during rapid loads. Even a valid `ended` report does not advance the queue; the server timer does.

The helper owns its own mute/volume state, starting at the same 30% default as native CLI Icecast. It registers as a browser with `ssh_mode = "webview"`, so pair-WS `toggle_mute`, `volume_up`, and `volume_down` controls must be applied inside `late-cli/src/webview/pair.rs` and forwarded into `page.html`; changing only the native CLI Icecast atom is not enough because YouTube audio is emitted by WebKit/GStreamer.

### Runtime support / troubleshooting

This feature is a real browser media stack inside a tiny helper process. Pair-WS protocol bugs show up in server logs; webview/browser/runtime bugs show up first in the per-user helper log (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/late/webview.log` or `~/.local/state/late/webview.log` on Unix, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\late\webview.log` on Windows). Interactive `late --verbose` parent logs go to the parent CLI log (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/late/late.log` or `~/.local/state/late/late.log`) so tracing does not corrupt the TUI; set `LATE_LOG_STDERR=1` for old stderr behavior.

- **Manual fallback:** if the embedded webview fails on a machine, open the normal browser connect page for the same SSH session. The server treats that real browser as the YouTube surface and tells the native CLI to close/skip the helper until the browser disconnects.
- **Arch/EndeavourOS + Wayland/Hyprland is proven** with WebKitGTK 4.1 plus GStreamer plugins. Known host package set:
  `sudo pacman -S --needed webkit2gtk-4.1 gst-plugins-good gst-libav`.
- **DMABUF renderer failures:** the Linux helper now sets `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` unless the user already provided a value. This is intentionally scoped to the helper process because some WebKitGTK/Wayland stacks fail or hang on the DMABUF renderer path.
- **Crash loop guard:** if the helper exits or fails to start 3 times within 60 seconds, the native CLI disables embedded YouTube fallback for 5 minutes and logs the helper log path. This stops repeated open/close loops while preserving the normal browser connect fallback.
- **Hyprland window routing.** The helper requests an undecorated window by default. The Wayland app id/class is `sh.late.youtube`; float/scratchpad rules can target it:
  `windowrulev2 = float, class:^(sh.late.youtube)$`,
  `windowrulev2 = size 480 320, class:^(sh.late.youtube)$`,
  `windowrulev2 = center, class:^(sh.late.youtube)$`,
  `windowrulev2 = workspace special:late silent, class:^(sh.late.youtube)$`,
  plus a bind like `bind = SUPER, Y, togglespecialworkspace, late`.
- **Linux X11** should be less fragile than Wayland because Wry's raw-handle path supports X11, but we still use the GTK builder on Linux so one code path covers both. WebKitGTK/GStreamer packages remain the main risk.
- **Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora** are expected to work once package names and WebKitGTK versions line up. Older distros may not ship the WebKitGTK 4.1 stack this branch expects.
- **NixOS** should get a first-class package/wrapper, not rely on a random Linux binary. Required runtime/build inputs are `webkitgtk_4_1`, `pkg-config`, `glib-networking`, and GStreamer packages (`gstreamer`, `gst-plugins-base/good/bad/ugly`, `gst-libav`). The wrapper/dev shell must expose `GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH_1_0` for `lib/gstreamer-1.0` and `GIO_EXTRA_MODULES` for `glib-networking`; otherwise WebKit can open but media/TLS pieces may be invisible. If this fails, the normal browser connect page is the supported fallback and suppresses the embedded helper automatically.
- **macOS** uses WKWebView and does not need GStreamer. Main risks are autoplay policy and ordinary macOS audio routing.
- **Windows** uses WebView2. Modern Windows usually has the runtime; the Windows volume mixer may expose the helper as its own app stream.
- **WSL/headless/container** are not supported unless there is a real desktop/webview runtime and working audio bridge.

Failure signatures:

- **No window:** check the per-user helper log. Past failures included Wayland raw-window-handle rejection and invalid GTK app id. Linux must use Wry's GTK build path (`build_gtk`) with Tao's `default_vbox()` container, and the GTK app id must remain valid reverse-DNS (`sh.late.youtube`).
- **White/blank window with GTK warning about `GtkApplicationWindow` already containing `GtkBox`:** the webview was mounted into the GTK window instead of Tao's default vbox. Use `window.default_vbox()` as the GTK container.
- **YouTube error 150 with "Video unavailable / Watch on YouTube" in CLI webview:** first verify the helper page URL is `http://localhost:<port>/`, not `127.0.0.1`, and that the response/meta referrer policy is `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` while `playerVars.origin = window.location.origin`. This fixed `r6L-GUOAhGo` on 2026-05-20. Some 150/101 failures are still true YouTube embed-policy rejections and will only work in the normal browser/YouTube surface.
- **YouTube error 153:** the IFrame Player rejected embed identity. The page must load from loopback HTTP as `localhost`, pass `window.location.origin`, and keep the explicit referrer policy; do not use `with_html`.
- **Black/unstarted player:** often missing GStreamer plugins. `GStreamer element autoaudiosink not found` means `gst-plugins-good` is absent.
- **Video moves but no sound:** verify helper mute/volume handling first (`m`, `+`, `-` should hit `late-cli/src/webview/pair.rs`, then `page.html`). If needed, click once inside the webview to satisfy an autoplay gesture. Also check the desktop mixer for a WebKit/late.sh stream.
- **First run plays through laptop speakers:** PipeWire/WirePlumber may treat the helper as a new app stream. Moving it once to headphones in the mixer usually teaches the session manager for later launches.

### Window UX

Current v1 opens a small undecorated companion window. Hidden/offscreen mode is not the default because embedded browser engines can throttle or unload hidden/minimized views, and the YouTube iframe's ads/branding/autoplay posture is cleaner with a visible surface. On compositors such as Hyprland, prefer routing the helper to a special workspace over manually parking it fully off-screen. A future config can add `youtube_webview = "window" | "hidden" | "disabled"` once hidden-mode behavior is validated per platform.

### What this does NOT change

- Server queue state machine and YouTube `load_video` protocol.
- Browser connect page behavior.
- Native Icecast decoder path when `audio_source = icecast`.
- External-player shell-outs remain out of scope; do not revive mpv/yt-dlp handoff unless the product/legal posture changes explicitly.

## 18. Parked: OS audio loopback for CLI-side visualization

**Status: parked, not on the active build path.** Premised on the embedded-webview CLI playback work — when the CLI hosts its own audio output (not just decoding Icecast), the iframe cross-origin constraint that blocks all real YouTube viz today simply goes away. Captured here so the design unlock doesn't get lost when that track is picked up.

### Idea

Tap the CLI's own audio output at the OS layer, run FFT locally, emit `VizFrame { bands[8], rms, track_pos_ms }` through the existing pipeline. Works uniformly for YouTube, Icecast, and anything else the user plays through `late`. The current browser-pair synthetic visualizer (§10) can retire — viz becomes CLI-owned across every source, and the pair-WS `viz` fan-in can be removed.

### Per-platform capture

- **Linux**: PipeWire stream linked to the CLI's output sink's monitor source. PulseAudio monitor source as fallback for non-PipeWire systems.
- **Windows**: WASAPI loopback on the default render endpoint (`IAudioClient::Initialize` with `AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_LOOPBACK`).
- **macOS**: ScreenCaptureKit audio (14+) for the modern path; CoreAudio aggregate / virtual-device plugin for older OS versions. Triggers a system-audio permission prompt the first time.

A single trait inside `late-cli/src/audio/` abstracts the platform-specific capture; one Linux backend can ship first and unblock the other two per-PR.

### What it unlocks

- Real reactive bars in YouTube mode — no procedural placeholder needed once embedded-CLI playback is the default surface.
- Single viz pipeline regardless of source. `procedural_indicator_bands` (§10) stays meaningful only for the **browser-pair** YouTube path — i.e. for users who haven't moved to the embedded CLI yet.
- Server no longer needs to fan out browser viz frames over the pair WS. Each CLI generates its own.

### Open questions

- **Per-process vs system-wide capture.** System-wide picks up whatever the user is playing outside `late`; per-process is more honest but requires extra plumbing (PipeWire per-app routing, CoreAudio AudioObject scoping). Reasonable starting point: per-process where the OS supports it, fall back to system-wide.
- **macOS permission UX.** First-launch prompt has to be explained somewhere (onboarding banner, `late doctor`, etc.).
- **Ordering vs procedural bars.** Procedural bars (§10) ship first and cover the current browser-pair surface; OS-loopback lands later and coexists. Both paths stay live until the browser-pair YouTube surface is retired (if ever).

### Reactivation criteria

- Embedded-webview CLI playback work is on the active roadmap or already shipped.
- We're willing to take on platform-specific audio code (the LATE bar to clear is one Linux backend).

Until then, browser-paired audio uses procedural bars for both Icecast and
YouTube (§10).

## 19. Queue state-drift hazards and reconciliation contract

**Status: active and implemented.** Anything new that mutates queue state must follow this contract.

### What went wrong (2026-05-19 incident)

Production stuck for ~1h45m. One row sat at `status='playing'` in DB. Every booth submit returned `db error: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "idx_media_queue_single_playing"`. Users couldn't add tracks or vote-skip.

Reconstruction from logs:

1. Pod restart at 09:44 UTC. `resume_from_db` adopted the lone playing row (Cyberpunk theme, started 09:40). Within seconds the playback timer fired (track was within ~1min of its real end). `finish_item` marked it `played`, `advance_to_next_with_guard` promoted the next queued row. Fine so far.
2. At some later point (logs don't pinpoint), `finish_item` was called for a row whose status was no longer `playing`. `mark_played`'s `WHERE status='playing'` returned 0 rows, and `finish_item` then early-returned `Ok(())` **without clearing `state.current_item_id`**. From this moment, `state.current_item_id` pointed at a row whose DB status had already moved on.
3. At 10:18:34 staff ran `/audio skip`. `force_skip` read the stale id and called `MediaQueueItem::update_status(stale_id, 'skipped')`. `update_status` has no `WHERE status=…` filter, so it cheerfully mutated the row from `played` → `skipped`. `state.current_item_id` was then set to `None` and `advance` was called.
4. From 10:19 onward, `state.current_item_id` was `None` in memory while the DB had `status='playing'` rows. Every `advance_to_next_with_guard` tried to promote a queued row via `mark_playing`, which violated the singleton index. Every booth submit failed.

The pod kept running this way for ~1h45m until manually restarted.

### Class of bug

Every queue-state mutation is two writes — the DB row's `status`/`started_at` column plus the in-memory `state.current_item_id` — and the old code:

- Issued the DB skip write *unconditionally* (`update_status` with no expected-old-status filter), so a stale id could quietly mutate the wrong row.
- Issued the in-memory write *conditionally* on the DB write returning rows changed, but treated `changed == 0` as "no-op, return early" instead of "drift detected, resync".

The current code makes those divergences recoverable without a pod restart.

### Reconciliation contract

The service now enforces these invariants. New code in this domain MUST follow them.

1. **No raw `update_status` for queue transitions.** Use `MediaQueueItem::mark_skipped(client, id, ended_at) -> u64` with `WHERE id = $1 AND status = 'playing'`. `force_skip`, the skip-vote-fired branch in `cast_skip_vote`, and `reevaluate_skip_threshold` route through it. Each caller treats `changed == 0` as drift, not success.

2. **`changed == 0` on any `mark_*` is drift, not a no-op.** `finish_item`, `fail_item`, `force_skip`, and the `mark_skipped` paths call the reconcile helper instead of returning early. That helper:
   - Cancels the existing playback timer.
   - Re-reads `MediaQueueItem::current_playing(&client)`.
   - If `Some(row)`: sets `state.current_item_id`, clears `state.skip_votes` if the id changed, reschedules the playback timer, broadcasts `SourceChanged` / `LoadVideo` / `QueueUpdate`.
   - If `None`: clears `state.current_item_id`, falls through to `advance_to_next_with_guard` (which may adopt or promote).

3. **`advance_to_next_with_guard` checks DB current first.** Before promoting a queued row, look at `current_playing` in DB. If DB already has one, adopt it (same code path as reconcile's `Some` branch) instead of trying `mark_playing` and racing the singleton index. This eliminates the singleton-violation symptom entirely — the loser of any race against the DB just adopts what's there.

4. **`mark_playing` unique-violation is recoverable.** Catch the constraint name `idx_media_queue_single_playing` in the Postgres error from `mark_playing`, treat it as "DB has a current we don't know about", route to reconcile. Never surface as a submit failure to the user.

### Why this beats a leader lock (for now)

A Postgres advisory-lock leader (§20) would prevent a *second pod* from also writing. The prod incident was a *single pod* corrupting its own state — a lock wouldn't have helped, and the next pod-after-handover would inherit the same bug class. The reconciliation contract makes every transition self-healing inside one pod; rule (4) also covers most of the rollout-overlap case for free (the loser of a `mark_playing` race reconciles instead of erroring at the user).

### Regression coverage

`late-ssh/tests/audio_queue_reconcile.rs` covers both prod shapes:
1. DB has a `playing` row while the service memory is empty; a subsequent submit adopts the DB current instead of surfacing the singleton violation.
2. Service memory points at an already-`played` row while DB has a different `playing` row; `/audio skip` reconciles and does not mutate the played row to `skipped`.

### What this contract does NOT cover

- **WS broadcast overlap during rolling deploys.** Two pods running for a few seconds during rollout will both broadcast `LoadVideo` / `QueueUpdate` to any browser that's connected to both. The browser receives duplicates and may visibly re-load. Cosmetic, not corrupting. If this becomes user-visible, escalate to §20.
- **Crash mid-transaction leaving the DB row as `playing`.** The 1h `sweep_orphan_playing` at startup is the existing safety net; reconcile shortens the window from "1h sweep" to "next time anything calls reconcile."
- **Multi-replica scale-up.** Still single-replica today. If we go multi-replica, the leader lock in §20 is the answer; the contract alone is not sufficient (followers would race on every advance and rely on the singleton index as the arbiter, which works but spams errors).

---

## 20. Parked: Advisory-lock audio leader

**Status: parked.** The reconciliation contract in §19 is the active fix and covers the realistic failure modes for a single-replica deployment. This is the next-step option *if* rolling-deploy WS overlap becomes user-visible OR we scale `service-ssh` past one replica.

### Idea

`AudioService` acquires a Postgres session-level advisory lock on a fixed key at startup. Only the lock-holder is the audio leader: it owns timer scheduling, queue mutation, and WS broadcasting. Followers (other replicas, the draining-out pod) keep serving SSH sessions but reject every audio-mutating call with a typed `NotLeader` error that surfaces as "audio is moving — reconnect" in the booth/sidebar.

```text
pod with lock     = audio leader, can mutate queue/timers, broadcasts ws events
pod without lock  = read-only follower; submit/skip/vote/advance return NotLeader
draining old pod  = releases lock + cancels timers in begin_drain()
new pod           = acquires lock + runs resume_from_db
old user sessions = stay connected but audio actions are rejected until they
                    reconnect to the new pod (k8s service routes new WS to leader)
```

### Sketch

- Pin a single pool connection for the lock. `pg_advisory_lock` is session-scoped; if the connection dies the lock releases, which is exactly the recovery behavior we want.
- Expose leader status as `watch::Receiver<bool>` so the sidebar/booth react to transitions, not just poll at action time. UI banner can react proactively rather than waiting for the user to press a key.
- A `LeaderGuard` zero-cost token returned by `acquire_for_mutation()`, required by every mutating method's signature. The compiler enforces the check instead of human discipline; trivial to miss otherwise given the surface (see below).
- `begin_drain()` releases the lock and cancels timers, letting the new pod take leadership before the old pod finishes draining its SSH sessions.

### Mutation surface that has to honor the gate

`submit_url`, `submit_trusted_url`, `submit_video`, `set_trusted_youtube_fallback`, `force_skip`, `cast_skip_vote`, `cast_vote`, `clear_vote`, `delete_queue_item`, `toggle_unskippable`, `report_player_state`, `finish_item`, plus all the `*_task` spawners that call them. A `LeaderGuard` parameter on the inner sync methods catches this at compile time.

### Why not yet

- The prod incident was single-pod state drift, not multi-pod contention. The reconciliation contract is the minimum viable fix; the lock is layered safety, not the bug fix.
- Big audit surface (above). Easy to miss one, and the failure mode of missing one is a hard-to-debug "this one path bypasses leader" inconsistency. Worth doing only when we know we need it.
- Leader-handover UX during rolling deploys needs design work (banner copy, reconnect timing, what the booth modal does when the lock moves mid-modal). Premature without the demand.

### Reactivation criteria

- The reconciliation contract in §19 is in place and stable.
- We see real WS-broadcast overlap symptoms (browsers double-loading items during rollouts) OR we want to scale `service-ssh` past one replica.
- We have a story for the "audio is moving" UX that's not just a banner the user sees mid-action.

Until then: §19 is the contract; one replica is the deploy.

## 21. CLI Voice Rooms

**Status: MVP implementation present / prod RTC infra wired.** Voice
implementation lives in `late-ssh/src/app/voice` and `late-cli/src/voice.rs`,
not inside the Icecast queue service. It is documented here because the
long-term CLI audio engine may need to mix house radio and voice output through
one device path.

### Product direction

Voice should be part of the late.sh clubhouse experience, not a second
Discord-like chat platform. Prefer "late voice rooms" over "calls"; voice
belongs to the room or synthetic voice surface the user is already sitting in.

First version:
- CLI-only voice controlled from the SSH TUI.
- `late` CLI users can join voice.
- Raw `ssh late.sh` users can see voice status, but cannot join because plain
  SSH has no microphone or speaker access.
- No browser requirement, video, screen share, recording, streaming, or DMs in
  the MVP.

### Initial scope

Start with one simple global/synthetic voice room:
- One synthetic `Voice` entry in Home, similar to Mentions/News/Work.
- One shared LiveKit room behind it.
- Functional controls first: join, leave, mute, deafen, show participant state.
- Users start muted when they join.
- Room scoping, per-channel voice, moderation controls, screen share, and DMs
  are later work.

Example TUI shape:

```text
Voice  #general
@mat speaking
@anna muted
@lee deafened

Enter join/leave   u mute mic   d deafen
```

### Architecture

Use LiveKit as the SFU:
- `late-ssh` owns auth, room mapping, moderation/control policy, and TUI state.
- `late-cli` owns microphone capture and remote voice playback. For the current
  MVP, both are handled by LiveKit's native `PlatformAudio`; do not add a
  second CPAL/manual remote-track output path unless the CLI audio engine grows
  a real mixer/jitter buffer.
- LiveKit runs as a separate service/container. Local dev has a `livekit`
  Docker Compose service; production uses `infra/livekit.tf`, exposed at
  `rtc.<domain>`.
- Voice media must not flow through the SSH render loop.
- The existing pair WebSocket is the control channel, matching paired
  audio/browser/CLI behavior. The CLI keeps one `VoiceRuntimeState` outside the
  per-WS connection loop so a pair-WS reconnect does not implicitly leave the
  LiveKit room.

Server to CLI:

```json
{ "event": "voice_join", "room": "general", "url": "wss://rtc.late.sh", "token": "..." }
{ "event": "voice_leave" }
{ "event": "voice_set_muted", "muted": true }
{ "event": "voice_set_deafened", "deafened": true }
```

CLI to server:

```json
{
  "event": "voice_state",
  "joined": true,
  "room": "general",
  "muted": false,
  "deafened": false,
  "speaking": true
}
```

While joined, the CLI re-sends `voice_state` every 15s. `late-ssh` prunes
displayed voice participants every 30s with a 90s TTL, so future changes must
keep this periodic state refresh or increase/remove the prune. The prune only
controls late.sh's participant snapshot; actual media membership is owned by
LiveKit and the CLI room object.

### CLI audio engine decision

Do not open a totally separate unmanaged output path for remote voice in the
MVP. LiveKit `PlatformAudio` enables microphone capture and speaker playout
with the WebRTC audio-processing path. A previous manual CPAL output queue
duplicated remote tracks and could stutter because frames were appended to a
single FIFO and drained directly by the audio callback.

The clean long-term version is one CLI audio engine that can mix:
- existing radio/music stream
- remote voice tracks
- local volume, mute, and deafen state

That reduces device conflicts and enables later polish such as ducking music
while people speak. Until that exists, LiveKit's Rust/native audio path owns
voice I/O separately and the compromise stays isolated behind
`late-cli/src/voice.rs`.

### Browser listen-only

`late-web/src/pages/voice/page.html` is subscribe-only. It attaches remote
audio tracks into a hidden root, deduping by track SID/media track ID/object so
`TrackSubscribed` plus the post-connect existing-track scan cannot double-play
the same track. It detaches on `TrackUnsubscribed` and clears all attachments
on disconnect.

### Risks and non-goals

- LiveKit Rust SDK is the intended tool, but native WebRTC linking and runtime
  behavior may be non-trivial: https://github.com/livekit/rust-sdks
- `cpal` provides cross-platform audio I/O, but echo cancellation is the hard
  part: https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal
- MVP assumes headset users and provides mute/deafen controls. Proper AEC/noise
  suppression can come later.
- WSL and Android need careful behavior because current CLI audio already has
  platform caveats.
- Screen sharing is explicitly out of first scope; CLI screen capture is
  platform-specific, especially on Wayland.

### Service direction

Voice service should run separately from `late-ssh`.

Local development:
- LiveKit is in Docker Compose as a separate RTC service.
- `late-ssh` mints LiveKit tokens and sends them over the pair WebSocket.
- `late-cli` connects directly to LiveKit.

Production:
- Separate Terraform-managed LiveKit deployment (`infra/livekit.tf`).
- Public RTC endpoint `rtc.<domain>` with WSS/API through ingress and media
  ports bound directly on the node.
- `service-ssh` gets `LATE_VOICE_ENABLED`, `LATE_LIVEKIT_URL`,
  `LATE_LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LATE_LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`, and `LATE_VOICE_ROOM` from
  Terraform.
- Keep SSH/API/web services responsible for control/auth, not voice media.

### Target implementation path

Done:
- LiveKit config parsing in `late-ssh`.
- One synthetic Voice entry in Home.
- Pair-WS control events for voice join/leave/mute/deafen.
- CLI capability advertisement for voice.
- CLI voice runtime boundary with LiveKit join/playback/capture; remote voice
  playout is LiveKit `PlatformAudio`, not a manual CPAL queue.
- CLI periodic `voice_state` refresh and voice runtime persistence across
  pair-WS reconnects.
- Browser listen-only `/voice` page with deduped/detached remote audio tracks.
- Terraform LiveKit deployment and `service-ssh` env wiring.

Remaining:
- Validate NAT/firewall behavior on the live host, especially direct
  `rtc.<domain>` DNS and UDP/TCP media ports.
- Add richer LiveKit health/metrics dashboards.
- Keep browser publishing, video, screen share, recording, and per-room voice
  out of the MVP.
